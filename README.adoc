= SOLUTION

Since me and hsqldb don't like each other...

I have switched db in solution to postgresql placed in docker. Commands to run solution:


----
docker pull postgres
docker run --name solution-postgres -p0.0.0.0:5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
mvn clean package
java -jar target/solution-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----


Solution description:

`kurylo.tech.solution.logs.Listen#processOnSpringContextRefreshEvent` is an entry point to start the whole process.

`kurylo.tech.solution.logs.LogProcess#saveInfoFromOneLine` is a spring asynchronous method, spring executes that method in separate thread that listener is running.

`kurylo.tech.solution.config.AsyncConfig` is a spring configuration that provides fixed executors pool with 100 threads. Number of threads can be variable in future releases. Now it is fixed to simplify solution.

All necessary configuration properties are placed outside the jar in `./config/application.yaml` file.
